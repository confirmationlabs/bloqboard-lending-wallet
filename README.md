# Bloqboard Lending Wallet

## Description
Bloqboard provides sophisticated cryptocurrency traders access to peer-to-peer and liquidity pool loans via a local API. The proposed API can also be used to provide borrowing/lending of tokens to customers of exchanges or custodians and allows aforementioned parties to keep custody of their assets. The solution is the Bloqboard Wallet, open-source software that runs on the server of your choice to enable interaction with Compound and Dharma protocol smart contracts (MakerDAO support to come shortly). The proposed solution can be accessed via API or autogenerated web interface (Swagger).
