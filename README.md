# Bloqboard Lending Wallet

## Situation overview

Bloqboard, a non-custodial Digital Asset Lending Platform powered by decentralized finance protocols MakerDAO, Dharma and Compound, provides the ability to borrow and lend certain ERC-20 tokens. Bloqboard enables three types of loans: 1) peer-to-peer loans via Dharma protocol, 2) borrow and lend on liquidity pools via Compound protocol and 3) Collateralized debt positions (CDP) via MakerDAO. The web application fulfills the needs of the average cryptocurrency trader or investor but is harder to run algorithmic trading strategies. This is where **Bloqboard Lending Wallet** comes in. We provide the first opportunity to engage in on-chain lending over an API in a non-custodial manner.

## Description
Bloqboard provides sophisticated cryptocurrency traders access to peer-to-peer and liquidity pool loans via a local API. The proposed API can also be used to provide borrowing/lending of tokens to customers of exchanges and allows aforementioned parties to keep custody of their assets. The solution is the Bloqboard Lending Wallet, open-source software that runs on the server of your choice to enable interaction with Compound, MakerDAO and Dharma protocol smart contracts. Additionally, the [Kyber network integration](https://github.com/bloqboard/bloqboard-lending-wallet/wiki/Kyber-Network-integration) automatically assists with dust and fee repayment of borrowed assets. The proposed solution can be accessed via API or the autogenerated web interface (Swagger) as seen below.
